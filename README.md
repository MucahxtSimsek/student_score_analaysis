# ðŸŽ“ Student Score Analysis

This is a project focused on analyzing student performance using Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze student score data to:
- Identify performance trends
- Compare average scores
- Find potential correlations (e.g., between study hours and scores)

##  Dataset

The dataset contains fictional student performance data:
- `name`: Student name
- `math_score`, `reading_score`, `writing_score`: Scores out of 100
- `study_hours`: Approximate weekly study time

##  Key Steps

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset
- Explored descriptive statistics
- Created visualizations (bar plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps)
- Highlighted key findings

##  Example Visualizations



## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I Learned

- How to structure a real data analysis project
- Practical use of Pandas for exploratory analysis
- Visual storytelling with Matplotlib and Seaborn
